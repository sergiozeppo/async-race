This is my implementation of RS School task 'async-race' 
[You can found it here:](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/stage2/tasks/async-race)

## DEPLOY
[Deploy](https://sergiozeppo-async-race.netlify.app/)
## NOTA BENE
For correct delpoy work you need to clone [server repo](https://github.com/sergiozeppo/async-race-api) and follow its instructions.

## Task "Async Race"
` Your customer has an idea to spend his money. He has hired some engineers who installed radio-controlled equipment üìª in real cars üöó, to be precise, all of his collection of cars. He is eager to create a kind of drag-racing competition in order to discover which car is the fastest. `
` Each radio controller has an HTTP-compatible interface. It lets you start or stop the engine of the car and, of course, enable "driving" mode.`
` Your task is to create a SPA to manage the collection of cars, operate their engines, and show race statistics.`
` Previously, development of this application had been started by a Belarusian developer named Dzmitry (and was almost finished). However, his laptop üíª was stolen by bad guys. Unfortunately, we don't have any sources of UI üòû. Fortunately, he had recorded some demo beforehand. Additionally, he had stored the server mock in his repo.`
` We found in the latest news that a new company called "The Fast and the Furious" announced the release of a new product that will really blow people's minds. There isn't a lot of information about this product. All we know is that it's about "easier car management than you can imagine." It's exactly what our thieves ü¶π are up to. They're going to release their product in two weeks. But we can't allow them to do that. We must be first.`
` What are you waiting for? Let's start coding!`

## üéØ Objectives
- Create a Single Page Application (SPA): Manage a collection of cars, operate their engines, and showcase race statistics in an engaging, interactive SPA.
- Revive the Project: Drawing inspiration from a demo video and a server mock, reconstruct the UI and breathe life back into this ambitious project.
- Outpace the Competition: Implement the project with speed and efficiency, ensuring we launch before our rivals, showcasing our innovative solution to car management and racing competitions.
## üöó Functional Requirements
### Basic Structure
- Two main views: "Garage" and "Winners", each with their name, page number, and a count of items in the database.
- Persistent view state between switches, maintaining user input and pagination.
### Garage View
- CRUD operations for cars with "name" and "color" attributes.
- Color selection from an RGB palette with a preview of the car in the chosen color.
- Pagination to display cars (7 per page) and a feature to generate 100 random cars at once.
### Car Animation
- Start/stop engine buttons with corresponding animations and handling of engine states.
- Adaptive animations that work on screens as small as 500px.
### Race Animation
- A button to start a race for all cars on the current page.
- A reset button to return all cars to their starting positions.
- Display the winner's name upon race completion.
### Winners View
- Display winning cars with their image, name, number of wins, and best time.
- Pagination and sorting capabilities by wins and best times.
## üìú Non-functional Requirements
- No Libraries/Frameworks: Pure JavaScript only, optional use of Bootstrap for CSS.
- TypeScript Mandatory: Strong typing throughout, with no use of "any".
- Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns between API interaction, UI rendering, and state management.
- SPA Implementation: Entire content generated via JavaScript, utilizing Webpack or similar for bundling.
- Code Quality: Adherence to Airbnb's ESLint configuration, with functions limited to 40 lines and avoidance of magic numbers/strings.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- Implement CRUD operations for cars using the provided server mock.
- Design UI elements for car management and race controls.
- Utilize fetch for server communication, and handle promises for asynchronous tasks.
- Create animations for car movements using JavaScript and CSS.
- Ensure responsiveness and compatibility across different devices and browsers.
